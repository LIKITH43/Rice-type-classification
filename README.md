# Rice-Type-Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Rice_Classifier.ipynb`) that demonstrates a machine learning approach to classifying rice types using image data, specifically utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Overview

The `Rice_Classifier.ipynb` notebook implements a classification model to distinguish between different types of rice based on their images. It covers the following key steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
    * Loads rice image datasets from specified directories.
    * Performs image resizing to ensure uniform input dimensions for the CNN.
    * Applies normalization to pixel values, scaling them between 0 and 1, which aids in faster convergence during training.
    * Splits the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's generalization ability.
    * Example preprocessing:
    ```python
    # Example code snippet for resizing and normalization
    img = cv2.resize(img, (IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE))
    img = img / 255.0
    ```

2.  **Model Building:**
    * Constructs a CNN architecture using Keras/TensorFlow, typically involving convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
    * Compiles the model with an appropriate loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification) and optimizer (e.g., Adam).
    * Example model creation:
    ```python
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE, 3)),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
    ])
    ```

3.  **Model Training:**
    * Trains the CNN model on the training dataset using the `fit` method.
    * Monitors training and validation performance (accuracy and loss) over epochs to prevent overfitting.
    * Example training:
    ```python
    history = model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=EPOCHS, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))
    ```

4.  **Model Evaluation:**
    * Evaluates the trained model on the testing dataset using the `evaluate` method.
    * Generates classification reports and confusion matrices to assess the model's performance in detail.
    * Visualizes the model's performance using plots of training/validation accuracy and loss.
    * Example evaluation:
    ```python
    test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
    ```

## Getting Started

To run the notebook, you will need the following:

* **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
* **Required Libraries:** Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow numpy scikit-learn matplotlib opencv-python
    ```

### Running the Notebook

1.  Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/LIKITH43/Rice-type-classification.git](https://github.com/LIKITH43/Rice-type-classification.git)
    cd Rice-type-classification
    ```

2.  Start Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3.  Open the `Rice_Classifier.ipynb` notebook and execute the cells.

4.  **Dataset:** Ensure that you have the correct rice image dataset in the correct folder structure, as expected by the notebook. The data should be organized into folders representing each rice type.

## Usage

This project can be used as a starting point for rice type classification or as an example of image classification using CNNs. You can modify the code to:

* Experiment with different CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
* Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) for better performance.
* Use different image datasets.
* Implement data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, zooming) to improve model robustness.

## Example

The notebook contains examples of how to load, preprocess, train, and evaluate the rice classification model. You can observe the model's performance through accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
